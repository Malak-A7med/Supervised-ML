# 🤖 Supervised-ML

Welcome! This repository contains simple, training-focused projects for Supervised Machine Learning, created and written by me during my learning process. I upload these projects so I can remind myself of what I learned and to help others who may find the examples useful.

📝 Purpose
- Create small, educational supervised learning projects written while training and experimenting.
- Organize examples by problem type: Classification and Regression.
- Each example includes the data source (or a link), training code, and a short explanation of the idea and results.
- The repo is primarily a personal learning log and secondarily a public set of runnable examples for others.

📦 Typical dependencies (example)
